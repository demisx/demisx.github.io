A few months ago, I finally had a chance to get my hands on the so-much-talked-about
[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) framework and I really digged it. In fact,
I like it so much that I am 100% sure this framework will stay ahead of others
for a long time. Well, in our world this means for at least another year or two.

<!--more-->

Though, I've got the basics down fairly fast, I had hard time around understanding
the proper code organization. Being a perfectionist didn't help either. Coming from a very
opiniated Rails framework it didn't feel comfortable at first that AngularJS gave
significantly more freedom to do things. But thank God the "Rails magic" is gone!

The type of questions that kept popping up in my head were:

* "OK, I want to code this functionality, but where shoud I really put it?"
* "Should I stick this code into a View controller, or should I put it into a Service?"
* "Perhaps, a directive could be a good place for it, but then where exactly in a directive?"

Doing my googling I've realized there were plenty of other pilligrims like me
trying to find their way in this new and exciting AngularJS world.

So, I am putting together this cheatsheet hoping it will guide us on where the stuff
should really go. It's not meant to be detail, but it should give you the right
starting point depending on what you are trying to achieve.


<div class="alert alert-warning">
<i class="fa fa-bell-o fa-2x"></i>
  *Please note, that I've intentionally omitted the `Service` component from this list.
  I find that using factories lets me accomplish everything I could do with
  `Service`, therefore I really had no real need to engage the latter. `Service`
  component does have some limited benefits if you are using CoffeeScript classes,
  but this would out of the scope of this post. Let's KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid).*
